		<h1><b>WORMHOLE</b></h1>
		
		<p>A wormhole is a theoretical passage through space-time that 
		could create shortcuts for long journeys across the universe. 
		Wormholes are predicted by the theory of general relativity. 
		But be wary: wormholes bring with them the dangers of sudden collapse, 
		high radiation and dangerous contact with exotic matter.</p><br/>
		
		<p>The basic notion of an intra-universe wormhole is that 
		it is a compact region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, 
		but whose interior is not simply connected.
		Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, 
		taken from Matt Visser's Lorentzian Wormhole </p><br/>
		
		<p>For a simplified notion of a wormhole,
		space can be visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) surface.
		In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, 
		lead into a 3D tube (the inside surface of a cylinder), 
		then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. 
		An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, 
		instead of circular holes on a 2D plane, the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in 3D space.</p><br/>
		
		<h2>WormHole in Interstellar</h2>

		<p>Gargantua's accretion disc contains gas and dust with the temperature of the surface of the sun. 
		The disc provides light and heat to Gargantua's planets.</p><br/>
		<p>The black hole's complex appearance in the film is due to the image of the accretion disc 
		being warped by gravitational lensing into two images: one looping over the black hole and the other under it.</p><br/>	
		<p>One feature of Einstein's equations is that time passes slower in higher gravity fields. 
		So on a planet orbiting close to a black hole, a clock ticks much more slowly than on a spaceship orbiting farther away.</p><br/>
